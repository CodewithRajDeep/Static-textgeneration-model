## Title: Static-Text Generation model 

## Description: 
This is project for my learning where I had developed a model using java and I had completed this project through the help of watching tutorial for Markov text generation. This project 
helps me to standardize the core aspects of framing and how the build is maintained and make operational for user-scenario uses.
